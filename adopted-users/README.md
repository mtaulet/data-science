# Predicting Rate of Product Adoption
Given a dataset with details about the creation of 12,000 online accounts, and a second dataset listing the days
in which each user logged in to the product, the goal is to determine the features that make a user more
likely to be an "adopted" user in the future. An "adopted" user is defined as a user that logs in to the
product at least three times in a seven day period.

The project consists on a jupyter notebook containing the code and a report pdf that lists the conclusions.
