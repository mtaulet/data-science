# Adopted Users
Given a dataset with details about the creation of 12,000 online accounts for an online product, and a second dataset listing the days in which each user logged in to the product, the goal is to determine the features that make a user more likely to be an "adopted" user in the future. An "adopted" user is defined as a user that logs in to the product at least three times in a seven day period.
